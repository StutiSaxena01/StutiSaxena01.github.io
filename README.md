# Assignment 2

- I have divided the entire website into three pages, `index.html`, `education.html` and `skills.html`. All the three pages are connected using `nav` bar where we can reach from one page to another by clicking on the respective link.The `nav` bar remains same on all the pages.

- The `nav` bar has a button called `Change Mode`. By clicking on `Change Mode`, we can switch from `dark mode` to `light mode` and vice-versa. `Dark mode` is the default mode for every page in the website.

- The `nav` bar also has a `About Me` section as `brand` which leads to the main page (index.html) everytime it is clicked.

- I have also included a `footer` which is also common for all the pages and has blinking text for contact details. The links are active and redirect to my personal instagram, linkedin and facebook profiles.
